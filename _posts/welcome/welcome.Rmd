Welcome to the new blog! This is a transition from WordPress to RStudio's new [Radix](https://rstudio.github.io/radix/) R Markdown package. Why? Well, WordPress would sometimes render my R code chunks a little funky---inserting odd characers here and there---and really only "fizable" within the editor. So, we'll try this. 

Right now, the plan is to re-post old items from WordPress. And then, add new material concerning Teaching, Consulting, and Statistics (mostly in `R`). If there's anything you'd like me to touch on, please just ask and I'll see what I can do.
